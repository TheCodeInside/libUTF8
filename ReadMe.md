# libUTF8

A super simple, super small, MIT-licensed UTF-8 library written in C11.
Learn about UTF-8 over [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)!

Now if you've read the Wikipedia article, you'd know that since 2003 characters
that were encoded to have 5 or 6 bytes are *technically* deprecated. Good news!
libUTF8 still supports them! :thumbsup:

Want to use libUTF8? Neat! Just drop `utf8.h` and `utf8.c` into your project
and you're good to go!
